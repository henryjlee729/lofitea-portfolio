This is a very important class that I needed to pass in order for me to be able to take upper-level computer science courses.  I have tried taking it in the fall semester but circumstances have made me unable to continue the class in that semester.\n\nHowever, when I took the class in the fall semester, someone from my class has made a website that contains all of the lecture notes.  The website was built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The link to the website is <a href = \"https://bejaranonotes.github.io/cs251/\"> here</a> and the link to the repository is <a href = \"https://github.com/BejaranoNotes/cs251\"> here</a>.\n\n## The Issue\n\nWhen retaking the class, I noticed that someone posts pictures of the lecture notes on a forum.  It is usually a pinned discussion post where anyone can see them.  The issue with me is that there are over 30+ lectures in the semester and I don't want to see 30+ different pinned comments where it can be hard to find all of the lecture notes.\n\n## What I Added\n\nI did not change too much regarding the website.  The overall structure is the same.  The only minor changes I made was replacing last semester's lecture notes with this semester's lectures notes as well as adding a small download button that allows a student to get all of the images as a PDF.  I felt that this would have been a convenient feature since it would allow a student to have one file with all of the notes for a specific day.  Down below is a visual of what the changes look like:\n\n![alt text](/images/bejanaro-notes/notes.png)\n\nWith the semester done (and thankfully passing my Data Structures and Algorithms class), the webstie is now done.  The link to the customized lecture notes website is <a href = \"https://lofitea.github.io/BejanaroNotes/\"> here</a> and the link to the repository is <a href = \"https://github.com/LofiTea/BejanaroNotes\"> here</a>."},"__N_SSG":true}
